    <p>
        What I enjoy most about the Information Systems program is the technical skills we learn.
        Software development and database management were my favorite from last semester, and I
        look forward to learning new languages and concepts this semester with ASP.NET. I hope I
        learn how to be confident when asked to learn a new language quickly. I hear that that is
        a great skill to have going into industry. Always evolving and always learning.
